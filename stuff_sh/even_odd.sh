# Exercise 7: Even/Odd Number Checker
# Write a script that accepts a list of numbers from the user (space-separated).
# Use a for loop to iterate over each number and an if condition to check if it's even or odd.
# Print whether each number is even or odd.

# read -p "Enter your number: " num

# for $num; do 
#     if (( $num % 2 == 0 )); then 
#         echo "$num is even"
#     else 
#         echo "it is odd"
#     fi 
# done



# read -p "Enter your number: " num

# for num in $num; do 
#     if [ $((num % 2)) = "0" ]; then 
#         echo even
#     else
#         echo odd 
#     fi
# done
